# Marc Villegas - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Marc! I have a Bachelors in Managerial Economics and Statistics from The University of California, Davis, and I am currently pursuing a Masters in Science degree for Computer Science at Georgia Tech. During my studies, I honed my skills in data management and statistical analysis by working with complex data and identifying trends and patterns in the data being analyzed.
I also have internship experience at CalPERS where I fist developed real world experience dealing with economic data indicators which I believe will be valuable experience in any data related role.
In my free time I enjoy learning about different data technologies and developing my data analysis skills. I enjoy working with others and communicating insights and turning it into actionable future oriented plans.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

#### Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

#### Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

#### Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

#### Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

#### Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
