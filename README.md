# Marc Villegas - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Marc! I have a Bachelors in Managerial Economics and Statistics from The University of California, Davis, and I am currently pursuing a Masters in Science degree for Computer Science at Georgia Tech. During my studies, I honed my skills in data management and statistical analysis by working with complex data and identifying trends and patterns in the data being analyzed.
I also have internship experience at CalPERS where I fist developed real world experience dealing with economic data indicators which I believe will be valuable experience in any data related role.
In my free time I enjoy learning about different data technologies and developing my data analysis skills. I enjoy working with others and communicating insights and turning it into actionable future oriented plans.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
