# Airline Project

# About

In this project I will be working with the csv files in the "files" folder which include information about new, cancelled and changed bookings.
I compiled the data into one csv file in order to estimate the benefit/loss due to cancellations and changes from 14.12.2013-13.01.2014.


# Skills Showcased

In this project I showcased my data manipulation and data visualization skills using Python. I used multiple packages such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib


# Output

The final output shows the airlines with the most gains from cancellations and changed bookings.



And it also shows airlines with the most losses from cancellations and changes bookings
